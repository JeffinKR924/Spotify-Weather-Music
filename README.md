# Spotify-Weather Music

This program allows the user to look up the current weather of any location, and also be recommended a Spotify playlist based on the weather of that location. 

You will receive the following information for any location that is entered:

**Weather Information:**\
Location\
Condition\
Temperature(Â°F)\
Minimum Temp(Â°F)\
Maximum Temp(Â°F)\
Feels Like(Â°F)\
Humidity(%)\
Wind Speed(mph)

**Spotify Information:**\
Playlist Name\
Playlist URI\
PLaylist HyperLink





## Usage
Run the Python file to open up the program interface. Type in a location in the search bar and press the search button to retrieve the information. To access the Spotify playlist, you can use the URI, or press on the hyperlink to automatically take you to the playlist through your webbrowser.

**NOTE:** Pressing the ENTER key on your keyboard won't initiate a search\
**NOTE:** If the information does not show up after you search for the location, then either there is a typo with what was entered, or that location is not supported with the weather API
